# iPFi - The Premier IP (Intellectual Property) Rewards Protocol

iPFi blends the bonding curve thrill of platforms like pump.fun with a backable digitized asset to reward early investors and IP holders. The way it works is simple:

## IP Holders

1.  **IP Opt-in:** IP holders opt-in to share their IP with the protocol.
2.  **Modular On-Chain Contracts:** IP holders define their terms with modular on-chain contracts.
3.  **Reward Collection:** IP holders reap rewards via IP purchases on the protocol.

## IP License Purchasers

1.  **Offer/Purchase:** Users can make offers on IP that isn't already listed or purchase IP licenses on the curve.
2.  **Derivative Assets:** Users purchase derivative assets that showcase their license contract on-chain.
3.  **Reward Earning:** Users earn rewards when the IP is used or when other people purchase rights to the IP.

## On-Chain Licenses

Our on-chain licenses enable users to showcase their contracts via a smart contract! The license between the IP holder and all the licensees are visible and verifiable on-chain, while being modularized to enable IP holders to adjust those contracts prior to creating them for things like term, exclusivity, and more.

## Physical Assets

Validating the legitimacy of physical assets is something we are working on and have seen other platforms do with mechanics such as warehousing or relying on 3rd-party certifications like PSA for cards for example. We are working on our own system to do this.

## Reward Payouts

When rewards are issued for the IP, users can harvest and claim from the pool. Any user can harvest the rewards for all the users in the pool, thus paying the gas fee, but only users who have a right to said claims can claim their rewards.

## FAQ

**Why a curve?**

The initial goal of platforms like pump.fun to create "unruggable" fungible tokens was misplaced and inaccurate. We aren't claiming that: we want to reward early investors into an IP and let IP holders, including those who purchase licenses, to earn for believing in the IP.

**What is the curve?**

We'll share details on how the curve works closer to launch as we're adjusting it often.

**Wen launch?**

No date is given yet as we're dogfooding our own protocol and want to ensure that we are ready for launch. We're likely to run a testnet campaign but that is unconfirmed.

**You said digitized assets. Do you mean RWAs?**

We originally had planned on launching to support only NFT assets, but the world has changed and we've changed with it. We're launching to support physical assets like jewelry and art as well as digital assets.

**Where is the AI in this?**

There isn't. Not everything needs AI.

**What chain are you launching on?**
